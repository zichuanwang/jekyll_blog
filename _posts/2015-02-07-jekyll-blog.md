I got the passion to start my own blog about a week ago. Yeah, I know I should do this a long time ago. I was aware of the benefits even before I went to college. I was just too lazy.

Anyway, I finally got here myself. Will update this post to introduce all the frameworks, software, services I used in building this blog.
